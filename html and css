 <h4>Movie Plot</h4>
 <p>
 Ishaan Nandkishore Awasthi is an 8-year-old boy who has trouble following school, though he is assumed
 by all to hate learning, and is belittled for it. His imagination, creativity, and talent for art and
 painting are often disregarded. His father, Nandkishore Awasthi, is a successful executive who expects
 his sons to excel, and his mother, Maya Awasthi, is a housewife frustrated by her inability to educate
 Ishaan. Ishaan's elder brother, Yohan Awasthi, is an exemplary student and a tennis player in whose
 shadow Ishaan remains. One day, Ishaan and his parents are called by Ishaan's principal to discuss his
 failures in class. Fed up of hearing Ishaan's failures and lack of improvement, Nandkishore sends
 Ishaan, mid-term, to a boarding school. Alone there, he rapidly sinks into a state of fear, anxiety, and
 depression, which is only worsened by the teachers there and their strict and abusive regime. His only
 friend is Rajan Damodaran, a physically disabled boy who is one of the top students and resides with his
 family there, as his father is part of the school's board. Ishaan contemplates suicide one day, but
 Rajan prevents him.
 Ram Shankar Nikumbh, a cheerful and optimistic instructor at the Tulips School for young children with
 developmental disabilities, joins the boarding school the same day, replacing the authoritarian Mr.
 Holkar, the school's former art teacher. Ram's teaching style is markedly different from that of
 Holkar's, and he quickly notes Ishaan's unhappiness that day after he fails to draw anything during the
 class. He reviews Ishaan's work and concludes that his academic shortcomings are indicative of dyslexia.
 Ram then visits the Awasthis in Mumbai, where he is surprised to discover Ishaan's hidden interest in
 art. Flustered, he demonstrates to Maya and Yohan how Ishaan has extreme difficulty in understanding
 letters and words due to dyslexia, and his poverty in sports skills stems from his poor motor ability.
 Nandkishore labels it as an intellectual disability and dismisses it as laziness.
 Back at school, Ram brings up the topic of dyslexia in a class by offering a list of famous dyslexic
 people. He comforts Ishaan, telling him how he struggled as a child as well. Ram obtains the principal's
 permission to become Ishaan's tutor. With gradual care, he works to improve Ishaan's reading and writing
 by using remedial techniques developed by dyslexia specialists. Eventually, both Ishaan's demeanor and
 his grades improve. One day Nandkishore visits the school and tells Ram that he and his wife have read
 up on Dyslexia and understand the condition. Ram mentions that what Ishaan needs more than understanding
 is that someone loves him. Outside Nandkishore sees Ishaan reading from a board. With teary eyes, he is
 unable to face his son and walks away.
 At the end of the school year, Ram organises an arts and crafts contest for the staff and students,
 judged by artist Lalita Lajmi. Ishaan's work makes him the winner and Ram, who paints Ishaan's portrait,
 is declared the runner-up. The principal announces that Ram has been hired as the school's permanent art
 teacher. When Ishaan's parents meet his teachers on the last day of school, they are left speechless by
 the transformation in him. Overcome with emotion, Nandkishore thanks Ram. Before leaving, Ishaan runs
 toward Ram, who lifts him high up in a hug.

 Dear Students
 Welcome to the DDUC parivar.
 Higher Education does not simply mean an arithmetic progression from Class XII to an
 Undergraduate
 Programme. It means, a qualitative leap into matured thinking, responsible conduct and
 taking
 charge
 of one’s career and life ahead. It is a leap not onto a stepping-stone but onto a path of
 lifelong
 learning. In the three-year time that you will spend here, our endeavour shall be to usher
 you
 to
 this path. So, look forward to an exciting year and fulfilling and fulfilled stay at the
 college.
 You will be the first batch of a three-year choice based-credit system of undergraduate
 studies.
 This is a nation-wide, uniform curriculum implemented by the University Grants Commission.
 The
 underlying spirit has been to facilitate inter-university migration and transfer of academic
 credits. Thus, if you choose or need to migrate to some other university within India and
 eventually
 abroad during the currency of a programme, you will be able to do so and take your credits
 earned
 along. You will not have to start afresh. The word ‘choice’ implies the doing away with the
 rigidities of a fixed curriculum. You shall have a bouquet of papers to choose from and
 design,
 as
 if it were, your own subject combinations from your own core discipline, other disciplines
 and
 skill
 based courses. We shall handhold you in making the right choices.
 Managing transition, however, is not easy. We have learnt this art through successful
 transition
 from annual to the semester mode, from a three-year to a four-year and back to three-year
 undergraduate programme. To facilitate the transition further, we are embarking on a
 student-mentoring programme with a view to attending to your scholastic, coscholastic and
 extra-curricular -activity related needs and requirements. We have designed an academic
 calendar
 too, that we shall be duly unveiling. During the upcoming year we shall also be relocated to
 our
 new
 campus at Dwarka. It shall be our collective responsibility to ensure that our migration to
 the
 new
 locality and transition to the new building is smooth.
 Feel free to share your aspirations, accomplishments and anxieties with your mentors. You
 are
 most
 welcome to get in touch with me at principaldducollege@gmail.com.</p>
